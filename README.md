#Digit Recognizer

This Digit Recognizer package provides an example of the use of supervised (machine) learning methods for the (multiclass) classification of a dataset. In the present case, the dataset consists in a large set of images representing handwritten digits (0 to 9). The goal is to be able to predict to which class (i.e. which digit) a given instance (image) belongs to. 

This dataset has been studied extensively (see [Yann LeCun's webpage][MNIST]); current best efforts with state of the art classification methods achieve remarkable success rates. The aim of this digit recognizer is not to improve on those results but to provide a testbed for trying to understand the results of a classifier and making the most out of it.
